# CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Code Review Checklist After Changes

## MANDATORY after EVERY code change:

### 1. Check syntax and linter:
- Execute `read_lints` for all modified files
- Ensure there are no syntax errors
- Fix all linter warnings

### 2. Check change logic:
- Ensure all used variables are defined
- Verify that deleted variables actually exist (use grep to search)
- Check imports and dependencies
- Ensure there are no unused variables in `del` or other operations

### 3. Check usage context:
- Find all places where modified code is used (grep, codebase_search)
- Ensure changes won't break other parts of the code
- Verify that changes are consistent with the rest of the codebase

### 4. Check edge cases:
- What happens if a variable is not defined?
- What happens if a function is called in a different context?
- Is there exception handling for all possible errors?

### 5. Test the changes:
- Run relevant tests if test files exist
- Verify that modified functions work as expected
- Test error handling paths
- Test with different input scenarios
- If modifying database operations, verify data integrity
- If modifying API calls, verify network error handling
- If modifying file operations, verify file system error handling

## DO NOT commit changes until you verify:
- No linter errors
- All variables are defined and used correctly
- No inconsistencies with the rest of the codebase
- All possible errors are handled
- Changes have been tested and work as expected

## Common error examples:
- `del variable` where `variable` is not defined -> use `if 'variable' in locals(): del variable` or `try/except`
- Using a variable before it's defined -> check code execution order
- Importing a non-existent module -> verify all imports
- Modifying a function that's used elsewhere -> find all usages via grep
- Not testing error paths -> always test both success and failure scenarios
- Not verifying backward compatibility -> check if changes break existing functionality
